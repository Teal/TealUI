<h1><a href="../doc/faq.html">faq</a></h1> <p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>

<h2 id="Where-can-I-find-these-docs-in-HTML">Where can I find these docs in HTML?</h2>

<p><a href="http://npmjs.org/doc/">http://npmjs.org/doc/</a>, or run:</p>

<pre><code>npm config set viewer browser</code></pre>

<p>to open these documents in your default web browser rather than <code>man</code>.</p>

<h2 id="It-didn-t-work">It didn't work.</h2>

<p>That's not really a question.</p>

<h2 id="Why-didn-t-it-work">Why didn't it work?</h2>

<p>I don't know yet.</p>

<p>Read the error output, and if you can't figure out what it means,
do what it says and post a bug with all the information it asks for.</p>

<h2 id="Where-does-npm-put-stuff">Where does npm put stuff?</h2>

<p>See <code><a href="../doc/folders.html">folders(1)</a></code></p>

<p>tl;dr:</p>

<ul><li>Use the <code>npm root</code> command to see where modules go, and the <code>npm bin</code>
command to see where executables go</li><li>Global installs are different from local installs.  If you install
something with the <code>-g</code> flag, then its executables go in <code>npm bin -g</code>
and its modules go in <code>npm root -g</code>.</li></ul>

<h2 id="How-do-I-install-something-on-my-computer-in-a-central-location">How do I install something on my computer in a central location?</h2>

<p>Install it globally by tacking <code>-g</code> or <code>--global</code> to the command.  (This
is especially important for command line utilities that need to add
their bins to the global system <code>PATH</code>.)</p>

<h2 id="I-installed-something-globally-but-I-can-t-require-it">I installed something globally, but I can't `require()` it</h2>

<p>Install it locally.</p>

<p>The global install location is a place for command-line utilities
to put their bins in the system <code>PATH</code>.  It's not for use with <code>require()</code>.</p>

<p>If you <code>require()</code> a module in your code, then that means it's a
dependency, and a part of your program.  You need to install it locally
in your program.</p>

<h2 id="Why-can-t-npm-just-put-everything-in-one-place-like-other-package-managers">Why can't npm just put everything in one place, like other package managers?</h2>

<p>Not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is a change.
This would be like asking git to do network IO for every commit.  It's
not going to happen, because it's a terrible idea that causes more
problems than it solves.</p>

<p>It is much harder to avoid dependency conflicts without nesting
dependencies.  This is fundamental to the way that npm works, and has
proven to be an extremely successful approach.  See <code><a href="../doc/folders.html">folders(1)</a></code> for
more details.</p>

<p>If you want a package to be installed in one place, and have all your
programs reference the same copy of it, then use the <code>npm link</code> command.
That's what it's for.  Install it globally, then link it into each
program that uses it.</p>

<h2 id="Whatever-I-really-want-the-old-style-everything-global-style">Whatever, I really want the old style 'everything global' style.</h2>

<p>Write your own package manager, then.  It's not that hard.</p>

<p>npm will not help you do something that is known to be a bad idea.</p>

<h2 id="Should-I-check-my-node_modules-folder-into-git">Should I check my `node_modules` folder into git?</h2>

<p>Mikeal Rogers answered this question very well:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mikealrogers.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html">http://www.mikealrogers.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html</a></p>

<p>tl;dr</p>

<ul><li>Check <code>node_modules</code> into git for things you <strong>deploy</strong>, such as
websites and apps.</li><li>Do not check <code>node_modules</code> into git for libraries and modules
intended to be reused.</li><li>Use npm to manage dependencies in your dev environment, but not in
your deployment scripts.</li></ul>

<h2 id="Is-it-npm-or-NPM-or-Npm">Is it 'npm' or 'NPM' or 'Npm'?</h2>

<p>npm should never be capitalized unless it is being displayed in a
location that is customarily all-caps (such as the title of man pages.)</p>

<h2 id="If-npm-is-an-acronym-why-is-it-never-capitalized">If 'npm' is an acronym, why is it never capitalized?</h2>

<p>Contrary to the belief of many, "npm" is not in fact an abbreviation for
"Node Package Manager".  It is a recursive bacronymic abbreviation for
"npm is not an acronym".  (If it was "ninaa", then it would be an
acronym, and thus incorrectly named.)</p>

<p>"NPM", however, <em>is</em> an acronym (more precisely, a capitonym) for the
National Association of Pastoral Musicians.  You can learn more
about them at <a href="http://npm.org/">http://npm.org/</a>.</p>

<p>In software, "NPM" is a Non-Parametric Mapping utility written by
Chris Rorden.  You can analyze pictures of brains with it.  Learn more
about the (capitalized) NPM program at <a href="http://www.cabiatl.com/mricro/npm/">http://www.cabiatl.com/mricro/npm/</a>.</p>

<p>The first seed that eventually grew into this flower was a bash utility
named "pm", which was a shortened descendent of "pkgmakeinst", a
bash function that was used to install various different things on different
platforms, most often using Yahoo's <code>yinst</code>.  If <code>npm</code> was ever an
acronym for anything, it was <code>node pm</code> or maybe <code>new pm</code>.</p>

<p>So, in all seriousness, the "npm" project is named after its command-line
utility, which was organically selected to be easily typed by a right-handed
programmer using a US QWERTY keyboard layout, ending with the
right-ring-finger in a postition to type the <code>-</code> key for flags and
other command-line arguments.  That command-line utility is always
lower-case, though it starts most sentences it is a part of.</p>

<h2 id="How-do-I-list-installed-packages">How do I list installed packages?</h2>

<p><code>npm ls</code></p>

<h2 id="How-do-I-search-for-packages">How do I search for packages?</h2>

<p><code>npm search</code></p>

<p>Arguments are greps.  <code>npm search jsdom</code> shows jsdom packages.</p>

<h2 id="How-do-I-update-npm">How do I update npm?</h2>

<pre><code>npm update npm -g</code></pre>

<p>You can also update all outdated local packages by doing <code>npm update</code> without
any arguments, or global packages by doing <code>npm update -g</code>.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the version of npm will progress such that the current
version cannot be properly installed with the version that you have
installed already.  (Consider, if there is ever a bug in the <code>update</code>
command.)</p>

<p>In those cases, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh</code></pre>

<h2 id="What-is-a-package">What is a `package`?</h2>

<p>A package is:</p>

<ul><li>a) a folder containing a program described by a package.json file</li><li>b) a gzipped tarball containing (a)</li><li>c) a url that resolves to (b)</li><li>d) a <code>&lt;name&gt;@&lt;version&gt;</code> that is published on the registry with (c)</li><li>e) a <code>&lt;name&gt;@&lt;tag&gt;</code> that points to (d)</li><li>f) a <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> that has a "latest" tag satisfying (e)</li><li>g) a <code>git</code> url that, when cloned, results in (a).</li></ul>

<p>Even if you never publish your package, you can still get a lot of
benefits of using npm if you just want to write a node program (a), and
perhaps if you also want to be able to easily install it elsewhere
after packing it up into a tarball (b).</p>

<p>Git urls can be of the form:</p>

<pre><code>git://github.com/user/project.git#commit-ish
git+ssh://user@hostname:project.git#commit-ish
git+http://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish
git+https://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish</code></pre>

<p>The <code>commit-ish</code> can be any tag, sha, or branch which can be supplied as
an argument to <code>git checkout</code>.  The default is <code>master</code>.</p>

<h2 id="How-do-I-install-node-with-npm">How do I install node with npm?</h2>

<p>You don't.  Try one of these:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://github.com/isaacs/nave">http://github.com/isaacs/nave</a></li><li><a href="http://github.com/visionmedia/n">http://github.com/visionmedia/n</a></li><li><a href="http://github.com/creationix/nvm">http://github.com/creationix/nvm</a></li></ul>

<h2 id="How-can-I-use-npm-for-development">How can I use npm for development?</h2>

<p>See <code><a href="../doc/developers.html">developers(1)</a></code> and <code><a href="../doc/json.html">json(1)</a></code>.</p>

<p>You'll most likely want to <code>npm link</code> your development folder.  That's
awesomely handy.</p>

<p>To set up your own private registry, check out <code><a href="../doc/registry.html">registry(1)</a></code>.</p>

<h2 id="Can-I-list-a-url-as-a-dependency">Can I list a url as a dependency?</h2>

<p>Yes.  It should be a url to a gzipped tarball containing a single folder
that has a package.json in its root, or a git url.
(See "what is a package?" above.)</p>

<h2 id="How-do-I-symlink-to-a-dev-folder-so-I-don-t-have-to-keep-re-installing">How do I symlink to a dev folder so I don't have to keep re-installing?</h2>

<p>See <code><a href="../doc/link.html">link(1)</a></code></p>

<h2 id="The-package-registry-website-What-is-that-exactly">The package registry website.  What is that exactly?</h2>

<p>See <code><a href="../doc/registry.html">registry(1)</a></code>.</p>

<h2 id="What-s-up-with-the-insecure-channel-warnings">What's up with the insecure channel warnings?</h2>

<p>Until node 0.4.10, there were problems sending big files over HTTPS.  That
means that publishes go over HTTP by default in those versions of node.</p>

<h2 id="I-forgot-my-password-and-can-t-publish-How-do-I-reset-it">I forgot my password, and can't publish.  How do I reset it?</h2>

<p>Go to <a href="http://admin.npmjs.org/reset">http://admin.npmjs.org/reset</a>.</p>

<h2 id="I-get-ECONNREFUSED-a-lot-What-s-up">I get ECONNREFUSED a lot.  What's up?</h2>

<p>Either the registry is down, or node's DNS isn't able to reach out.</p>

<p>To check if the registry is down, open up
<a href="http://registry.npmjs.org/">http://registry.npmjs.org/</a>
in a web browser.  This will also tell you if you are just unable to
access the internet for some reason.</p>

<p>If the registry IS down, let me know by emailing or posting an issue.
We'll have someone kick it or something.</p>

<h2 id="Who-does-npm">Who does npm?</h2>

<p><code>npm view npm author</code></p>

<p><code>npm view npm contributors</code></p>

<h2 id="I-have-a-question-or-request-not-addressed-here-Where-should-I-put-it">I have a question or request not addressed here. Where should I put it?</h2>

<p>Discuss it on the mailing list, or post an issue.</p>

<ul><li><a href="mailto:npm-@googlegroups.com">npm-@googlegroups.com</a></li><li><a href="http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues">http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues</a></li></ul>

<h2 id="Why-does-npm-hate-me">Why does npm hate me?</h2>

<p>npm is not capable of hatred.  It loves everyone, especially you.</p>
